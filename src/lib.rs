//@ # Dylib exploration
//@
//@ ## What is this?
//@ This is a fluent Rust file exploring dynamic system configuration using specs ecs and libloading.
//@
//@ ## How does it work?
//@ It uses [Tango](https://github.com/pnkfelix/tango) to explore working with dylibs in a sort-of interactive format.
//@
//@ To see it in action, pull down this crate, and run `cargo test`. That will load these markdown files up, convert them to `.rs` files, and execute the tests. Note: This crate does codegeneration and runtime compilation: you will need a modern (1.13, as of time of writing) rust installation, though if you're running `cargo test`, you're already there!
//@
//@ ## First, our dependencies
//@
//@ ### [Specs](https://github.com/slide-rs/specs)
//@ An entity component system
extern crate specs;

//@ ### [libloading](https://github.com/nagisa/rust_libloading)
//@ A library for helping us load rust dylibs
extern crate libloading;

//@ ## Next, lets grab what we need
//@
//@ ### From libloading
use libloading::Library;

//@ ### From specs
//@
//@ ## Our supporting modules
//@ ### [Dylib codegen](./dylib_codegen.md)
mod dylib_codegen;

//@ ## And the rest!
//@
//@ Currently we do nothing. Heres a test block so something shows up on `cargo test`

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
    }
}
